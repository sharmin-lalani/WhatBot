# WhatBot - A standup emulation bot

## **Problem Statement**

A stand-up meeting is an integral part of any technology project team using agile processing. Everyday each team member  answers a set of questions regarding what they have been working on, whatâ€™s next, any problems being faced etc. 

Now, imagine a team of 10 members. The project manager asks the same set of questions to each member sequentially . Assuming that each team member takes about 2-3 mins to answer the questions asked by the Project Manager. Hence, the Stand-up meeting would take minimum of 20 mins. 

How about automating this using a bot? Everyday, at a particular time, the bot asks the same pre-defined set of questions to all the team members simultaneously. The bot can gather the answers of all the team members, consolidate them into a report and share it with all the stakeholders. This approach provides the flexibility to the employees, as they can read the updates as per their convenience, or skip the updates that they are not interested in. This helps in saving considerable time.

Another case is when the project manager or team member is not in office, and cannot attend the stand-up. The bot will help enable information dissemination as if the whole team were physically present for the meeting. Also if some stakeholder is on leave of absence, the consolidated email will help keep the stakeholder updated as to what happened when he/she was away.


## **Bot Description**

We have deployed a bot that interacts with team members, records their updates, and generates a consolidated report which is shared with all stakeholders.
